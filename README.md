I do NOT use any Cloud managed cameras I do NOT let 3rd party company to store my footage. DIY
A project to build a CCTV recording system for home using raspberry pi. 
Raspberry Pi 4B can easily record 10+ IP cameras in HD quality footage.
It automatically rotates the footages files to maximize disk space. 
It can record any IP camera as far as it supports RTSP streaming protocol.
Raspberry pi 4B and Reolink wifi camera cost less than $100 each.
